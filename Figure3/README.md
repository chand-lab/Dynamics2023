# Figure 3 plots toe firing rates of Heterogeneous units in PMd during decision-making
 
Open 'plotFigure3.m'. If you want to display the first unit presented in Figure 3 run the following command:

```
 Fig3Neurons(1)
```

The number corresponds to the order of presentation in the figure. You can plot all 6 units in this manner (e.g., Fig3Neurons(2) will plot the second and so on). Plotted units are shown organized by coherence and RT, as well as aligned to cue and movement onset. Scaling may be slightly different between the figures in the paper and what is plotted from MATLAB.
